## üîê Terraform State Locking

Terraform uses a locking mechanism to prevent multiple operations from modifying the same remote state file at the same time.

This is critical for avoiding race conditions in CI/CD or team environments.

### üîß How State Locking Works

Terraform acquires a lock file (`.lock.hcl`) when you run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`. It automatically releases the lock when the operation completes successfully.

If the process is interrupted, the lock may remain, blocking future commands.

### üß™ When You Might See Lock Errors

- Interrupted `terraform apply` (e.g. Ctrl+C or crash)
- Two sessions apply simultaneously
- CI/CD pipeline didn't clean up properly

### üöë How to Troubleshoot & Fix Lock Errors

#### üîç Error Example
Error acquiring the state lock
StatusCode: 412
PreconditionFailed: At least one of the pre-conditions did not hold


#### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Get the Lock ID from the error message:**
Lock ID: 0fa1e684-4c48-b086-d9c1-59934f22a246

2. **Run the force-unlock command:**
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
3. **Re-run your command:**
terraform apply --auto-approve
